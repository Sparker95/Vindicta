Garrison is a class that is supposed to help with garrison management. That is, keeping track of units and vehicles at some location.

I know there are no classes in ARMA SQF but let's treat it as a class, ok?

By ARMA type classification, garrison is an array of unit classnames, vehicle classnames, objects and other things like that, with structure yet to be determined.

All actions with garrison must be made through special functions, so no {...}forEach - loops and other crap with garrison arrays outside of Garrison folder, allright?

Probably the garrison must be somehow associated with some location for unit spawning.

Garrison should have a template associated with it where to find classnames from.

Probably except for being spawned and despawned garrison doesn't need to handle its own spawning, but it can handle the simulation enabled/disabled of its own units with BIS Dynamic simulation or with whatever else.

Garrison can have two major states: spawned and not spawned.

Garrison can be of two major types: active, which can spawn other units when spawned, and passive, which can't spawn other units.


Things you can do with garrisons:
Create a new garrison array through a special function.

Add/remove unit(s) to/from garrison

Split a garrison into two garrisons.

Add two garrisons together to make a new garrison.

Spawn the whole garrison.

Despawn the whole garrison.

All the actions with garrison must work regardless of garrison's state. That is, adding garrison to another garrison must work regardless of each of the garrisons being spawned or despawned.

TODO list:
- Add group management (restructure existing groups)
- Add group types for group management
Possible group types:
- Non-static vehicle and its crew(tank, APC, MRAP, assault boat, helicopter, airplane)
- Static vehicle(s) and its/their crew
- Sniper/marksman/sharpshooter sentries for watchtowers
- Ground patrol
